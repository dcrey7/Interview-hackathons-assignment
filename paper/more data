The stochastic model used in this paper is a Markov model for simulating the payment behavior and collections from individual accounts with defaulted debt. Here are the key details:

Inputs/Parameters:
- Bi1 - Initial outstanding balance for account i
- Ci1 - Credit score for account i 
- Si1 - Initial operational segment for account i (1, 2 or 3 representing different collection strategies)
- Yi0 - Payment indicator for account i in month preceding the simulation (0 or 1)
- Pit = P(Yit=1|Yi(t-1),...,Yi0,Zit) - Probability of payment in month t, modeled via logistic regression as a function of credit score, previous payment, and operational segment.

Stochastic Process:
1) Initialize Bit, Cit, Sit, Yit according to the input parameters
2) For each month t:
    a) Calculatepit using the logistic regression model
    b) Simulate Yit ~ Bernoulli(pit)  
    c) If Yit = 1 (payment made), set Xit = min(50, Bit) as the collections amount
        Else Xit = 0
    d) Update Bi(t+1) = Bit - Xit
    e) Update operational segment Sit based on transition rules

This defines a Markov process for {Xit}, the collections from account i over time.

Outputs:
- Xit - Collections from account i in month t
- Xi = Sum(Xit) - Total collections from account i over simulation period

By simulating many realizations of this process and averaging, they can estimate E[Xi] and other quantities of interest.

Data Creation:
The paper does not use real data. The input parameters are randomly generated from specified distributions to create a representative heterogeneous population of accounts. Repeated stochastic simulations from the model for each account produce the data used for analysis and methodology development.
